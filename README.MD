## DESCRIPTION:
An ASI plugin that will make pedestrians (including Tommy himself) more talkative,
like they were on PS2 version of the game. See PedSpeech.ini for details on how
to make Tommy even MORE talkative.

## UPDATE 26/08/2015:
Fixed an issue with a speech timer which caused several speeches to play only once.

## SUPPORTED VERSIONS:
* 1.0
* 1.1
* Steam

## INSTALLATION:
Put PedSpeech.asi and PedSpeech.ini files into your GTA Vice City folder.
